  <ul>
    <li>This feature allows "External" faculty to be paid more efficiently using an automatically generated Limited
      Engagement Form.
    </li>
    <li>By clicking "Edit," the information for the form for an External lecturer can be viewed. Most of this
      information will be automatically populated from information entered for the course or kept in a database. Some
      brief editing might be required. Hit "Save" after editing.
    </li>
    <li>The document (in Word format) can be viewed by clicking "View".</li>
    <li>After the External lecturer has given their last lecture in the course, it will be possible to submit the form
      to the Business Office from the "edit" screen of the form. The name of the course coordinator will be sufficient
      for the signature. At this stage, the course coordinator does not have to do anything further, unless there is a
      request for clarification. This submission will also send the course syllabus to the Business Office for full
      documentation of the lecturer's teaching.
    </li>
    <li>It is important that the course coordinator performs this submission step soon after the date on which the
      External lecturer completes their lectures. Please keep this date in mind for each External lecturer.
